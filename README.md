# Introduction to Rust

This repository contains two exercices `matrix` and `singer`.

## Installing Rust
### Linux & Mac
To install Rust, just copie the following line into the terminal.

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

You also need to add the binaries to the `PATH`. You can do that by adding the following line into the `.bashrc`.

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin
```

### Windows
You can download and execute the `.msi` file [here](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.23.0-i686-pc-windows-msvc.msi).

For more [information](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).
